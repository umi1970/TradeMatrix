notes: |
  - **INSTITUTIONAL SETUP** - Based on month-end rebalancing flows
  - Funds must rebalance portfolios at month end
  - This creates predictable buying/selling pressure
  - Volume is the key confirmation - no volume, no trade
  - EMA20 turning positive shows momentum shift
  - Best results in last 2-3 trading days of month
  - Combine with sector analysis for higher confidence
  - Watch for portfolio rebalancing news
  - Scale in: Start with 50%, add at 0.5:1 RRR
