Subject: Grow Plan - Indices Listed but Not Available via Quote API (Refund Request)

Dear Twelvedata Support Team,

I am writing to report a critical issue with my Grow Plan subscription ($29/month).

PROBLEM:
Several major indices are listed in your /indices endpoint but return 404 errors when attempting to fetch quotes via /quote endpoint.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:

1. DAX Performance Index (GDAXI):
   - Listed in /indices endpoint: ✅
     Symbol: GDAXI
     Exchange: XETR
     Country: Germany

   - Quote API Response: ❌ 404 Error
     Endpoint: /quote?symbol=GDAXI&exchange=XETR&apikey=XXX
     Error: "symbol or figi parameter is missing or invalid"

2. NASDAQ 100 & Dow Jones Industrial Average:
   - NOT listed in /indices endpoint at all
   - Total indices in response: 1,353
   - US indices: 0

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
Major indices like DAX, NASDAQ 100, and Dow Jones should be:
1. Listed in the /indices endpoint
2. Available for quote retrieval via /quote endpoint
3. Included in the Grow Plan as advertised

BUSINESS IMPACT:
I subscribed to the Grow Plan specifically to track these major market indices for my SaaS application (TradeMatrix.ai). Without access to these indices, the plan does not meet the advertised functionality.

REQUESTED ACTIONS:

Option 1 (Preferred):
- Enable DAX (GDAXI/XETR), NASDAQ 100, and Dow Jones for quote retrieval on my Grow Plan account
- Confirm which plan tier includes these indices if Grow Plan doesn't support them

Option 2:
- Full refund of my Grow Plan subscription ($29)
- Cancel subscription immediately

ACCOUNT DETAILS:
- Plan: Grow Plan ($29/month)
- API Key: c25b65a4f77c488ca9b318faf5b21ef7
- Subscription Date: [Your subscription date]

Please respond within 48 hours with:
1. Confirmation of whether Grow Plan supports these indices
2. If not, which plan tier does
3. Refund timeline if indices are not available

I would prefer to continue using Twelvedata if these indices can be made available, but I require a prompt resolution.

Thank you for your immediate attention to this matter.
