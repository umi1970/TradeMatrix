## Questions & Decisions

### Open Questions
1. **Chart Data Source:** Twelve Data API or TradingView screenshots + OCR?
2. **AI Model:** GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o for pattern recognition?
3. **Hosting:** Railway vs Fly.io for FastAPI + Celery?
4. **Redis:** Self-hosted (Docker) or Upstash (managed)?
5. **Email Service:** Resend vs SendGrid vs AWS SES?

### Decision Log
- **Oct 26:** Chose Supabase over custom PostgreSQL + Auth
- **Oct 26:** Next.js 16 with App Router (no Pages Router)
- **Oct 26:** FastAPI only for AI agents (no CRUD endpoints)
- **Oct 29:** Prioritize Phase 2 (Trading Logic) before Phase 3 (AI Agents)
